PHP-Errors-Class
================

Debugging a PHP application by relying exclusively on the internal error reporting mechanism that PHP provides is literally like searching for a needle in a haystack. 
For those of you who don't want or can't use a cool extension like Xdebug, I wrote a class that enhances the standard error reporting in PHP.

Usage: Just instantiate the class before any other code

** It would be great if anyone would extend this so that we can have some database profiling, memory usage management and so on **
